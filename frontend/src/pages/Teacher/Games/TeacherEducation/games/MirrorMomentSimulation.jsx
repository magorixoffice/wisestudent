              Use alone time after school for mirror talk reflection. After the students leave and the classroom is quiet, take 5-10 minutes to sit with yourself. Speak your feelings aloud, even if it's just to the empty room. This practice helps process the day's emotions, release guilt or shame, and prepare you to leave work at work. You can do this in your car, in an empty classroom, or at home—anywhere you can be alone with your thoughts.
