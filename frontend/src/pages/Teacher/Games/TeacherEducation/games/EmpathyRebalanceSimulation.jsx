                    Reinforce "listen–support–refer" as healthy empathy model. This three-step approach helps you manage compassion sustainably:
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>1. Listen:</strong> Give your full attention and validate feelings. This shows empathy without taking on the full burden.
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>2. Support:</strong> Offer appropriate help within your role and capacity. This maintains boundaries while being helpful.
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>3. Refer:</strong> Connect them with appropriate resources (counselor, support services, professional help). This ensures they get comprehensive support while preserving your energy.
                    <br /><br />
                    The listen–support–refer model allows you to care deeply while maintaining your capacity. Practice this model regularly, and share it with colleagues to create a culture of sustainable empathy.
